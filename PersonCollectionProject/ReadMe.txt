Explanation about my answer.

I made an example in the main function.
The Class Person implements the IPeson (the interface you gave me) for creating persons.

I created the IPersonComparable which has the comparison signature of the unknown algorithm.
For creating my PersonCollection you have to send the constructor the IPersonComparable algorithm (injection).
I made 2 examples Classes for the algorithm CompareId, CompareFirstName which implements the IPersonComparable.
In the collection class I made subscribe and unsucbscribe methods for the listeners (subscribers).
I did also SubscriberClass to demonstrate the publish functionality.

Thank you and have a good weerk,

Netanel Aknin.
